# Car rental web application

The main goal of this project was to build an efficient application with a user-friendly interface.
Which would help small and medium sized businesses to grow and earn profit. This web
application was build based on comparison with other websites and I can state that the
application meets most of the requirements of car rental agencies. Moreover, during
implementation of the program, I learned a lot about back-end development, configuration of
database, architectural patterns. Mainly I gained experience working with Spring Boot
frameworks and learned how to quickly build an optimized products with effective tools.
Finally, car rental web application was successfully developed and tested. It provides intuitive
interface for customers so they could easily navigate through website and book online cars. The
security system works in proper way and implements multiple layers of protection to ensure
that user data and transactions are safe from potential vulnerabilities
